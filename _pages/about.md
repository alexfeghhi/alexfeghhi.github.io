Greetings! My name is Alexander Feghhi. I’m a recent graduate of **UC Santa Cruz**, having majored in **Cognitive Science** and minored in **Computer Science**. Career-wise, I’m interested in **software engineering**, **data science**, and, should the opportunity present itself, **startups**[see my cv](/cv/).

Outside of work, my hobbies include **programming**, board games, video games, **grappling**, and **writing**. I usually program in **Python**, focusing on data science [projects](/projects/). My favorite board games are Settlers of Catan and chess (I was a youth player representing Spain internationally). I enjoy **wrestling** and **Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu** (wrestling is the one true sport). I will occasionally update the [blog](/blog/) section with my writings on various topics.

My intellectual interests include **artificial intelligence**, the **social sciences**, **computer science** and **machine learning**. My interest in AI comes not from a deep learning perspective but rather a Cognitive Science perspective emphasizing computationalism and nativism. I’m also interested in looking at the social sciences, not from a qualitative social constructionist perspective but a quantitative perspective analyzing the common human psychological structure. As far as computer science and machine learning go, I have limited knowledge but am hoping to learn more.
